# Echoes #

## About ##
The Echoes mod adds sculk-corrupted variants of well known mobs. These creatures are known as Echo's and have been corrupted by sculk and have forgotten who they are. They act on instinct alone and are aggravated by sounds so beware!

Currently implemented:
* Echo Creeper - An echo variant of the creeper

Echo mobs only spawn on top of sculk, so make sure you don't leave your sculk unattended and unlit.
This mod was created for the 2024 SpookyJam.
